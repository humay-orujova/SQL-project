# SQL-project

### Project Overview

This project involved analyzing customer data from an online marketing campaign to uncover insights into customer behavior, spending patterns, and the effectiveness of promotional campaigns. Using SQL, I performed data cleaning, transformed the data into smaller, more manageable tables, and executed exploratory analyses to answer key business questions.

### Data source

[Customer Personality Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis): This dataset contains details on customer demographics, spending behavior, and responses to marketing campaigns. The dataset is used to analyze customer behavior and segmentation in a marketing context.

### Tools

- **SQLite** - Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Analysis

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

Key data preparation steps included:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Removed NULL values from critical columns (e.g., customer ID, income, etc.), ensuring data integrity.
2. **Data Transformation:** Split the original dataset into smaller tables (e.g., People, Products, Promotion, Place) to streamline analysis and optimize query performance. Each table focused on specific aspects of customer data, such as product spending, promotional responses, and purchase behavior.

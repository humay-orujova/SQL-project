# SQL-project

### Project Overview

I am currently working on a project where I analyze customer personality in the context of a marketing campaign. The project involves working with a customer dataset and leveraging SQL for data analysis and reporting. I am focusing on identifying key customer behaviors and trends to provide actionable insights for marketing strategies.
